        <div class="sukuna"><h2>Sukuna</h2></div>
        
        <div class="ct">According to legend, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon (仮か想そうの鬼き神じん Kasō no Kijin?) during the Heian Era. In truth, he was a human sorcerer also known as the Disgraced One (堕だ天てん Daten?).[2] Jujutsu sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu gave their all against him but ultimately fell one after another. Sukuna existed throughout the ages by transforming into a cursed object after death, a state where he split his power into twenty indestructible fingers.</div>
        
        <div class="ct">Malevolent Shrine (伏ふく魔ま御み廚づ子し Fukuma Mizushi?):[106] Sukuna's domain expansion creates a Buddhist shrine decorated with skulls. Everything within the domain is relentlessly slashed with either Dismantle or Cleave, depending on its cursed energy level. Malevolent Shrine has a unique trait; it doesn't create a separate space using a barrier and is instead manifested into the surrounding airspace. By allowing an escape route, a binding vow is formed which vastly increases the guaranteed hit's effective area with a maximum radius of nearly 200 meters.Like other powerful characters, Sukuna can use Domain Expansion. His Domain Expansion is named Malevolent Shrine. And unlike others, his Domain Expansion has no barrier. That means people can move in and out of his Domain Expansion.

            The special thing with his Domain is how his technique upgraded. We mentioned above that he can use Dismantle and Cleave to cut everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="Gojo"><h2>Gojo</h2></div>
        <div class="ct">Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Clan, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.<br>&nbsp;Unlimited Void (無む量りょう空くう処しょ Muryōkūsho?): Satoru's Domain Expansion. It creates a metaphysical space that causes the victims to receive all kinds of stimuli and information endlessly, restraining their thought processes and actions.[56] In terms of raw strength, Satoru's domain is equal to Sukuna's on the inside, only losing due to Malevolent Shrine's open domain that allowed Sukuna to destroy the barrier of Unlimited Void.[57] Satoru's skill with his Domain Expansion is so great that he can precisely activate it for only 0.2 seconds, limiting its lasting effect on those he traps within it,[58] and is able to freely change the conditions of Unlimited Void's barrier. Satoru himself and those he makes physical contact with are immune to its effect.</div>
